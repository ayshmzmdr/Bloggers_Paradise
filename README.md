# Bloggers_Paradise
A website to share your views and see what other's think about the topic

To avoid unneccessary bot posts, one has to log in to post or read the blogs

## How to run the website
Go to your terminal, change your directory to this folder and then type `python manage.py runserver`

A localhost link will be generated. `CTRL+Left click` the link OR `copy and paste` the link in your browser. You will be sent to the home page of the application
